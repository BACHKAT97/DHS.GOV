Since the debut of our initial Open Government Plan, we have met with various web content-related groups and defined this process, which will adhere to the following key principles:    \r\n1.\tDHS will continually review current inventories and portfolios of data sets and tools and identify high value data sets and tools for electronic dissemination in support of Transparency and Open Government goals. Reviews are anticipated on a quarterly basis.  What is the \u201chigh value criteria\u201d the data meets: information that can be used to increase agency accountability and responsiveness; improve public knowledge of the agency and its operations; further the core mission of the agency; create economic opportunity; or respond to need and demand as identified through public consultation.\r\n2.\tAt the planning stage for any new data development endeavor or major revision of existing data development efforts, and throughout the life of the project, DHS will identify opportunities for transparency, data sharing and dissemination though electronic posting of datasets.  These dissemination activities will become part of the project or system plan for the data project. We have implemented this guidance as part of our DHS Systems Engineering Life Cycle and Enterprise Architecture program and incorporated it into the ongoing monitoring of IT projects and investments that are accomplished using DHS\u2019s IT investment life cycle planning and execution processes. As opportunities for data sharing and dissemination are identified, they will be evaluated and adjudicated by the DHS Web Council Information\/Mobile Community of Practice after receiving dataset release approval from the respective Component governance bodies. \r\n3.\tDHS will protect the confidentiality of individually identifiable information in any public data releases, including publication of data sets on the web.  Recognizing that the risks of disclosure of personal identifiable information mount as more and diverse data sets are released into the public domain, DHS will lead and support ongoing research into strategies to protect confidentiality while maintaining public access to data.  As new approaches evolve, DHS will incorporate them into its data release and privacy policies.\r\n4.\tDHS will undertake efforts to foster the use and utility of the data it disseminates publicly through the web and seek feedback from data users.  DHS will consider specific audiences, market segments and communication objectives in its data development and dissemination programs.\r\n5.\tDHS will ensure the quality, objectivity, integrity and utility of the substantive data it disseminates through compliance with DHS Information Quality Guidelines.\r\n6.\tDHS will employ feedback, outreach and evaluation mechanisms regarding the value and utility of the information we disseminate and use that information to enhance and improve our data products and services in a continuous quality improvement cycle.  \r\nOur updated data sharing process will be enmeshed into the department\u2019s core strategic planning, budgeting, and information technology planning activity for 2014.  Key points:\r\n\u2022\tDHS\u2019s Enterprise Architecture will identify one or more experts for each investment initiative who will bring not only subject matter knowledge to the team but will also serve as a resource regarding available DHS data systems which may support the initiative as well as principles of performance measures, evaluation and information quality.  The data experts themselves will convene on a regular basis as a cross-DHS team to coordinate their work and share best practices across the department.  Plans and recommendations emerging from each initiative will be employed by the DHS CIO Council in its overall data planning and investment priorities. \r\n\u2022\tData production and sharing opportunities proactively targeted by each investment initiative will be added to an ongoing stream of new data sets identified for publication on Data.gov through regular portfolio reviews conducted by each DHS agency and office and coordinated by the Web Council and CIO Council.  The Web Council will ensure that data releases are screened for quality, privacy, security, and confidentiality risks before release.  Data releases will be prioritized based on alignment with DHS\u2019s strategic goals.   \r\n\u2022\tAt the planning stage for any new data development endeavor or major revision of existing data development efforts, and throughout the life of the project, DHS will proactively identify opportunities for transparency, data sharing and dissemination through electronic posting of datasets on Data.gov.  These dissemination activities will become part of the project or system plan for the data project.  This new aspect of data and systems planning will be incorporated into the core management processes, templates and criteria utilized by DHS\u2019s information technology, investment review, and budgeting processes.\r\n\u2022\tThe Web Council will continue to oversee and manage the process of releasing information assembled via all of the sources above on our Open Government website, Data.gov and other mechanisms.\r\n\u2022\tA key principle underlying our Open Government work is promoting transparency while maintaining confidentiality.  This will require an ongoing effort involving those developing the data and data users and is made all the more challenging by the increasing amount of data from a wide variety of sources that conceivably could be linked to confidential data.  The linkage could yield valuable insights but could also lead to the disclosure of confidential information.  This challenge is shared by agencies across the government.   DHS will work with other agencies to develop confidentiality safeguards for data submitted to Data.gov that will increase the amount and scope of data disseminated while developing ways of preserving the confidentiality of the data's sources, whether individuals or businesses.  \r\n\u2022\tDHS will engage in a proactive new program of monitoring, stimulating, and incorporating innovative and beneficial uses of our data. \r\no\tOn our Open Government website and through systematic dialogue with key stakeholder groups (overseen by our Web Council), we will solicit examples of how our data has been used to generate benefit.  We will continue to maintain a list of examples (insights, applications, visualizations, etc.) for publication on our Open Government website.  This will help us shape our future data release strategy on an ongoing basis.\r\n\u2022\tBy employing these processes for ongoing data prioritization, release, and monitoring, DHS intends to increase the value produced by its information resources in several ways.  Consumers will be able to access information and benefit directly from using it personally, as when somebody planning to travel familiarizes themselves with disease risks and vaccinations.  Beyond that type of use, DHS intends for the information to prove valuable for improving public administration, positively impacting how we and other levels of government can deliver services and accomplish our missions more effectively, more efficiently, more rapidly, and with higher levels of customer satisfaction.  \r\n\u2003\r\n\u2022\tExternal Affairs, Strategic Communications and OCC will be included during initial meetings between Open Data Coordinator and Program Office and external clients as needed\r\n\u2022\tOpen Data Coordinator coordinates approvals from OCC, Privacy Offices and the Offices of External Affairs\r\n\u2022\tSupporting Documents will include metadata descriptions, directions on how to use the data, appropriate data disclaimers and approval sign-off form \r\n\u2022\tPrivacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) will be filled out as is deemed by Privacy or OCC"}],"multiple":false},{"id":"2.2","parent":null,"text":"Make high-value data and content in at least two existing, major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems","due":"12 months","due_date":"2013\/05\/23","fields":[{"type":"select","name":"2-2-status","label":"Overall Status","options":[{"label":"Not Started","value":"not-started"},{"label":"In Progress","value":"in-progress"},{"label":"Completed","value":"completed"}],"value":"completed"}],"multiple":false},{"id":"2.2.1","parent":"2.1","text":"Publish plan on future activity","due":"12 months","due_date":"2013\/05\/23","fields":[{"type":"textarea","name":"2-2-1-describe","label":"Describe policy","options":[],"value":"Data dissemination is the process for releasing data for consumption by external partners or the public. Data dissemination strategies are used to effectively communicate to the data users the need to make known its availability. Data and information can be disseminated in various formats designed to suit the needs of particular users. The objectives of the data dissemination strategy are to maximize the response of the system to user needs when developing information or data dissemination, increase access to information by disseminating directly to other Components and\/or organizations, and standardize Information Sharing exchanges to use common data exchange specifications like NIEM to improve consistency and understandability. Delivery mechanisms for data to be disseminated are based on the needs of the consuming user. \u2022 Information products: Information products like reports, spreadsheets, notifications and memos are the most commonly accepted forms for this type of data dissemination. Traditionally, these data dissemination products were known to users of the associated systems. Today, wider knowledge of these products is required and the EAIR provides a central source for discovering their existence. The SELC will require metadata for each of the products to be presented for inclusion into the EA Information Repository. The metadata profile for each information product will improve understandability and visibility of the content, structure and intended uses. \u2022 Data Access and Delivery Services: Utilizing services to enable delivery of data increases its flexibility and scalability to the user community and other systems. In order to support this capability, systems will need to include data access and delivery services within their architectural framework. System designers will also have to determine the level and quality of service being provided so consumers can understand when the data will be available. Each data access service will require metadata to be defined and made available to consumers. Using the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) to develop the metadata will improve consistency and understandability. \u2022 Web and mobile apps: Utilizing application program interfaces either through web or mobile apps improves the opportunity for consumers to get machine readable versions of the data for consumption or ingestion into their systems or application. Data.gov and the DHS Digital Strategy guidelines require new data sets to be developed with this capability. The DHS data dissemination strategy supports the 21st Century Digital Government Strategy, through the completion of several milestones. The Digital Government Strategy requires the Department to make high-value data and content available using Web APIs (milestone 2.2), and also to improve customer facing services for mobile use (milestone 7.2). Data Dissemination is a critical component in the identification of additional high value assets. DHS has a System Engineering Lifecycle (SELC) that provides a framework for development using proven systems engineering principles to ensure DHS capabilities are efficiently and effectively delivered. The DHS SELC is designed to ensure that appropriate activities are planned and implemented in each stage of the life cycle to increase the success of each program and its projects. Each stage has a defined set of activities, associated documents to record the results of the activities performed, and reviews at the appropriate points in the lifecycle. DHS OCIO is currently conducting Program Assessment Reviews, which provide leadership with an extensive deep-dive into program activities and assess program\u2019s responses to the Earned Value Management, program artifacts, alignment with mission needs, and alignment with the DHS Enterprise Architecture. The Program Assessment Reviews have embedded specific criteria to support the Digital Government Strategy to categorize the DHS major programs that are exposing data to citizens or government entities, are seen as the \u201cGo-To\u201d or Service Provider for public facing information, have development efforts underway, and have adequate funding to support the development activities.\r\n"}],"multiple":false},{"id":"2.2.2","parent":"2.1","text":"Make 2+ systems (datasets) available via web APIs with metadata tags","due":"12 months","due_date":"2013\/05\/23","fields":[{"type":"text","name":"2-2-2-system","label":"Name of system","options":[],"value":["National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS)","FEMA Hurricane Evacuation Route Data","TSA Traveler Assistance","OpenFEMA API","Enterprise API"]},{"type":"textarea","name":"2-2-2-description","label":"Description of system","options":[],"value":["The National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) API provides a feed of National Terrorism Advisory System current alerts that can be used by developers to place this information in their own apps and web pages.","FEMA has released an API providing geospatially-enabled hurricane evacuation route data that can be leveraged by developers in their own apps and web pages.","TSA MyTSA API provides TSA Security Checkpoint Wait Times, TSA Pre\u2713\u2122locations, and Sunrise\/Sunset times for all locations","FEMA has developed a new content management systems using MongoDB to store datasets and provide a search capability to extract the dataset in a machine readable format.
